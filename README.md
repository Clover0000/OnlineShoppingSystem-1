The object of this project is trying to implement serveral Java Web technologies into practice. I spent almost one month to do the self-study of JSP and construct the website. Thanks to this experience, I now reach a level of intermediate of handling the Servlet and JSP. 

This project is based on MVC design pattern, implemented several Front-End technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), designed a reliable online shopping website in B/S structure. The system is divided into 2 entries—buyer entry and administrator entry. Buyer is able to sign up/login, browse the site notice, check good details, search goods, manage shopping cart and settle account. Administrator has more authorities—perform management over the goods as well as users.    

The user entry is totally made by myself, the backstage part is made by a groupwork of me and Kung Chen. 

(If you want to log in as an administrator, just input admin/admin as username and pasword to access the backstage)
